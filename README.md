## Local use

Open `index.html` in a browser. The starter admin password is:

```text
learnview-admin
```

The app works offline with local records until a data connection URL is saved in **Setup > Connection URL**.

## Google Sheets setup

1. Create a Google Sheet.
2. Open **Extensions > Apps Script**.
3. Paste the contents of `apps-script/Code.gs`.
4. Save and run `setupSheets` once, or use the connection test after deployment. The script creates and repairs these sheets:
   `Settings`, `Subjects`, `Students`, `Schedule`, `Attendance`, `Assessments`, `Invoices`, `InvoiceItems`, `Payments`, `ReportCards`, `Messages`.
5. Deploy as a web app with access set to the tutor account or anyone with the link, depending on your deployment needs.
6. Open LearnView Nexus, go to **Connection Setup**, paste the deployment URL, and click **Test connection**.
7. Use **Sync now** to push current data or **Load from Sheets** to pull existing data.

## GitHub Pages deployment

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In GitHub, open **Settings > Pages**.
3. Select the `main` branch and root folder.
4. Save. GitHub Pages will serve the static web app.

## Notes

The app is static and GitHub Pages-ready, with Capacitor Android support included for APK builds.
